# icinga-guacamole

Integrate your Icingaweb2 GUI with your Guacamole server. 

These pages will help you create links to your servers and other network devices from the GUI without having to manually copy links into your configuration. They may be placed directly on your Icinga web server or elsewhere your clients can reach the page.

Read my blog post at https://redbridge.se/blog/ and Icinga Conf Berlin 2022 talk at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9su6-9vv0s to integrate Icingaweb with your Guacamole web service that uses a MySQL/PostgreSQL database.
