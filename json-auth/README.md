This sample page will allow you to redirect your clients to your Guacamole JSON-authenticated server. 

Customize the `baseurl` variable to suit your environment. The `baseurl` is the base url to the Guacamole web service.

URLs are expected to be in this format `redirect.html#dst=myhost` where `myhost` is the name of the connection profile in Guacamole.
